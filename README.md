## SoccerSTATS.com Scraper

**Description:** Actor to get football data from popular football leagues for 2021-2022 and 2020-2021 seasons. Soccer data includes matchweeks, tables, and schedules from 15+ European football leagues. 



Our SoccerSTATS.com Scraper provides an unofficial SoccerSTATS API for extracting the data on match results, schedules, progress over the weeks, etc. Using this scraper, you can pull data from the soccerstats.com website; it works best with leagues and matches pages.

## Features

So far, there are *four* main types of soccer stats data you can collect:

 - results from **league tables** containing statistics of how every team has been performing within the current league: the games played, wins vs. losses, goal differences, etc. It can contain leagues happening in one or different countries.
 - the entire **season schedule** for one or multiple leagues.
 - all available statistics of the **current matchday** for selected leagues. 
 - get the soccer games data from a specific **range of matchdays**â€” for instance, data from week 1 till week 7. 


## Cost of usage

Following our basic plan, the scraper's run will extract you **1,000 results for less than 1 USD credits**. For more details about the plans we offer, platform credits, and usage, see the  [platform pricing page](https://apify.com/pricing/actors).

If you're not sure how much credit you've got on your plan and whether you might need to upgrade, you can always check your limits in the  _Settings_  ->  _Usage and Billing_  tab in  [your Console](https://console.apify.com/). The easiest way to know how many credits your actor will need is to perform a test run.

## Input parameters

If this actor is run on our [Platform](https://console.apify.com/), our brand new user-friendly interface will help you out in configuring all the necessary and optional parameters of this scraper before running it. This scraper recognizes the following input parameters:

 - **informationType** will define what category of information you're scraping from SoccerSTATS:
	 `TABLES` will scrape the entire **league table** and form a separate data block for every team with their names, current position on the chart, the number of games played, won, lost, points gained, etc. 
	 - `CURRENTWEEK`  corresponds with the **current matchday** feature. Matchday, in this case, is a relative term since some games happen a few days apart. This parameter will deliver a dataset containing all games happening at home and away this week, + which week number it is of the season, halftime, and final scores. It will also contain the results of planned games that don't have scores yet. 
	 - `SELECTEDWEEKS` corresponds with the **range of matchdays** feature and will allow getting matchday results within a time range of choice, e.g., from week 2 till 7 of this season. The time range can be defined using the `startWeek` and `endWeek` inputs. If you are using a different **Information type** input - `TABLES`, for example, you can safely ignore this pair of values.
	 - `FULLSCHEDULE` will get you the entire **season schedule** from start to finish, with scores and who was playing home/away. Note that this parameter provides everything but the matchday digit. So if you really need the matchday number as a part of your output, you can instead run the `SELECTEDWEEKS` and manually add the first and the last weeks. For example "1" as `startWeek` and "34" as `endWeek` parameter. 

 - **selectedLeagues** (*optional*). You can scrape these available leagues (with numbered countries being the lower league divisions): `brazil`, `czechrepublic`, `germany`, `germany2`, `denmark`, `england`, `england2`, `spain`, `spain2`, `france`, `france2`, `greece`, `netherlands`, `italy`, `italy2`, `poland`, `portugal`, `russia`, `turkey`.

 - **season** - lets you scrape the data from current or past seasons. So far, the available season inputs are: `2021-2022`, `2020-2021`.

**Note: You can follow the descriptions in the input editor to build your inputs easier.**

###  Example

```javascript
{  
	"informationType":  "CURRENTWEEK",  
	"selectedLeagues":  ["England"],  
	"startWeek":  1,  
	"endWeek":  10,  
	"proxyConfig": {  
		"useApifyProxy":  true 
	},  
	"season":  "2021-2022"  
}
```


## Output

The output from SoccerSTATS.com Scraper is stored in the  _Apify Dataset_. After the run is finished, you can choose to present and download the contents of the dataset in various data formats (JSON, XML, RSS, HTML Table).

###  Example

```javascript

  "matchWeek": "14",
  "date": "30-11",
  "home": "Newcastle Utd",
  "score": "1 - 1",
  "away": "Norwich City",
